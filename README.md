# IFEM-THMCoupledEP
A thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) coupled solver for porous media based on the Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) toolbox [IFEM](https://github.com/OPM/IFEM). This solver considers the phases of the porous media to be compressible, unlike [IFEM-THMCoupledEP](https://github.com/yaredwb/IFEM-THMCoupledNL).

**Note:** This repository is not upto date with the latest version of the IFEM toolbox.
